# Anagramika

*Anagramika* is an anagram bot for telegram. You can play anagram either in a Private chat setting or in group chat with friends(this is fun!!)

Anagramika is written in python and uses PyTelegramBotAPI as abstraction layer to the BotAPI provided by telegram. This bot is designed to get updates via webhook and is written specifically to be deployed on heroku.
